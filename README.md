##Contents

The Jupyter notebooks containing the figures in the papers are found in the directory, `notebooks/`
On Github you can view them directly in your browser:

- [Figure 1(i): Hysteresis plots] (notebooks/figure-1i-hysteresis-plots.ipynb)
- [Figure 1(ii): 3D states with corresponding magnetisation profiles] (notebooks/figure-1ii-3D-states-with-profiles.ipynb)
- [Figure 1(iii): Comparing the magnetisation profiles] (notebooks/figure-1iii-profile-comparison.ipynb)
- [Figure 2: Hysteresis phase diagrams] (notebooks/figure-2-hysteresis-phase-diagrams.ipynb)

The PDFs generated from these notebooks are also included in this repository. They can be found at `notebooks/pdfs/`

The raw data can be found in the directory `data/figure_*/`, where * is either 1 or 2 corresponding the relevant figure number.
Various data types are found in these directories - explanations of them can be found in the notebook, [data-format-explanations] (notebooks/data-format-explanations.ipynb)
